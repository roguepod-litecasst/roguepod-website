# Welcome to the RoguePod LiteCast Blog

Hey roguelite fans! We're excited to launch the official RoguePod LiteCast blog.

## Why a Blog?

While our podcast episodes dive deep into individual roguelite games, we wanted a space where we could share:

- **Extended thoughts** on games we've covered
- **Quick takes** on new roguelite releases
- **Updates** to our tier list rankings
- **Community highlights** from our Discord
- **Behind the scenes** podcast production stories

## What to Expect

We'll be posting regularly alongside our bi-weekly podcast episodes. Some posts will complement episodes, while others will be standalone content about the roguelite genre we love.

## Stay Connected

Make sure to:
- Subscribe to the podcast on your favorite platform
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/GHsdfVGR)
- Follow us for updates

We're just getting started, and we can't wait to share more content with you!
