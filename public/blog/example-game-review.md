# Deep Dive: Why Slay the Spire Changed Roguelites Forever

When Slay the Spire launched in early access in 2017, nobody could have predicted just how influential it would become. This game didn't just succeed—it created an entire subgenre of roguelite deckbuilders.

## The Perfect Formula

Slay the Spire nailed three key elements:

1. **Accessible Complexity** - Easy to learn, impossible to master
2. **Build Variety** - Every run feels different
3. **Risk vs. Reward** - Constant meaningful decisions

## The Legacy

Since Slay the Spire, we've seen incredible games follow in its footsteps:
- Monster Train
- Inscryption
- Balatro
- Griftlands
- And dozens more

## Why It Still Holds Up

Years later, Slay the Spire remains in our S-tier for good reason. The base game is perfectly balanced, and the modding community keeps it fresh with new content.

If you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for?
